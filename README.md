This monorepo hosts the codebase of a [@davidevmod/focus-trap](https://github.com/DaviDevMod/focus-trap/tree/main/packages/focus-trap) package and a [Next.js app](https://github.com/DaviDevMod/focus-trap/tree/main/apps/demo) serving as environment to e2e test the package, as well as an interactive demo (and exercise for my front end skills).

This project has been my playground for learning about _npm_, _Node.js_, _TypeScript_, e2e tests, monorepos and much more.

Many thanks to [belgattitude/nextjs-monorepo-example](https://github.com/belgattitude/nextjs-monorepo-example) which has been a great point of reference for the current monorepo setup.
