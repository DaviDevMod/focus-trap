# Focus trap

This monorepo hosts the codebase of a `@davidevmod/focus-trap` package and a Next.js app serving as demo for the package (and exercise for my front end skills).

This project has been my playground for learning about _npm_, _Node.js_, _TypeScript_, e2e tests, monorepos and much more.

Many thanks to [belgattitude/nextjs-monorepo-example](https://github.com/belgattitude/nextjs-monorepo-example) which has been a great point of reference for the current monorepo setup.
